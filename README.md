## Information

### Features
This mod adds some small tweaks and qol rules to your survival world. These rules are changeable through the `survivaltweaks.properties` file. _Note: Ender man griefing isn't configurable yet_

The current feature list contains:
- No "too expensive" warning which prevents having a lot of enchants on a single item. _Note: This also makes enchanting in an anvil cheaper_
- No enderman griefing, except pumpkins and melons for farming purposes
- Make the debug stick functional in survival
